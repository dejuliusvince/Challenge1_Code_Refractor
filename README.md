# Challenge 1 Code Refractor
## Assigned Task:

* Refractor starter code of a webpage to meet the user's accessibilty standards and organize/consolidate the html and css.

## Actions taken...

* The starter html tags were not semantic; div was used throughout when semantic tags could make the document more orgainized. I replaced all the div tags with semantic html. I also added figure wrappers around the article's images.

* There were several reduncancies on the stylesheet, and an error is calling a selector that prevented the nav bar from formatting in the proper way. I fixed this by calling the selector properly.

* Necessary alt tabs were added to the img elements for greater accessibilty.

* The first nav li element was not linked properly, this was fixed by adding the assigning the id called in the a tag. Now all three buttons take the user to that article when the nav li text is clicked.
